Version 0.3 adds compatibility with Firefox 1.5 and Thunderbird 1.5.

<LI> <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/locallink/locallink-0.2.xpi">locallink-0.2.xpi</a>:
Version 0.2 adds submenus for opening in new tab/new window/etc. 
Works with Firefox (tested with 1.0PR, should work with 0.8+ through 1.0) and Thunderbird (tested with 0.8, should work with 0.7 through 0.8+).
<BR>
When updating from 0.1, I suggest you remove the old extension first.

<LI> <a href="http://downloads.mozdev.org/locallink/locallink-0.1.xpi">locallink-0.1.xpi</a>:
Version 0.1 is bare bones. No preferences, no fancy dialogues. 
Works only with Firefox (tested with 1.0PR, should work with 0.8+ through 1.0).

<h5> Protocol handlers</h5>
<P>
If you want to pass links from Thunderbird to an external browser using LocalLink, handlers for the appropriate protocols have to be set up. For local links the protocol is <code>file</code>.
You set up the handlers in the same way in which you make Thunderbird open links in Firefox.
</P>
<h5>Localisation</h5>
<P>
From version 0.2 on, LocalLink uses &quot;universal localisation&quot;:
it takes all labels from the main application, so that they are localized whenever you have a language pack for the latter.
